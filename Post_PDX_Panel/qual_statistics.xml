    <description>
        Checks paired end fastq files for overall quality, and performs
        some statistical analysis.
        Terminates the run if less than 50% HQ reads.

        Files passed to this tool, ins and outs:
        Ins: 
          1: end1.fastq1
          2: end2.fastq1 end1.fastq2 end2.fastq2 ...
          3: filter directory
        Outs:
          1: end1.fq_trimmed
          2: end2.fq_trimmed

        Note that out_1 and out_2 are not referenced in this file.
        These files are produced implicitly.  But by referencing them
        in the outs list, we get them appropriately marked for
        our file-based dependency job scheduling.
